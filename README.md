# Titanic Machine Learning Classifier using Logistic Regression

This project aims to predict whether a passenger survived or not in the Titanic disaster using machine learning. The dataset used for this project is the Titanic dataset from Kaggle, which contains information about the passengers' demographics and their survival status.

*Steps:*

Data Preprocessing: Data cleaning and feature engineering.
Model Training: Train multiple models, including Random Forest Classifier.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Cross-Validation: Perform cross-validation for better model evaluation.

*The following Python libraries are required for the project:*

pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
missingno: for visualize null values
matplotlib & seaborn: for visualize data
sklearn: For machine learning algorithms and evaluation.
lazypredict: For quick model comparison and selection.
